This repository contains  a collection of tools (mostly in python and jupyter notebooks) giving examples how to work with the DREAM output or input files (plots, analysis, etc).

Feel free to update it with  your own codes and tools! (fortran, python, any language accepted! ;) )

NB: If you encounter problems to see the notebooks, copy/paste the address in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
